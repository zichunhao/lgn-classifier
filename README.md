# Lorentz Group Network Jet Classifier
This is a classifier trained on the hls4ml 150-particle jet dataset. The architecture is based on [The Lorentz Group Network](https://github.com/fizisist/LorentzGroupNetwork) introduced by Bogatskiy et al. in [arXiv:2006.04780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04780) and its [adaptation](https://github.com/faroukmokhtar/LGN) by Farouk.
